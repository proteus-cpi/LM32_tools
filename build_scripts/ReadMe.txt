==========

These are few build scripts for the lm32 toolchains that worked for me. [Mainly to have a known good
starting point].

The Makefiles are adaptations of the lm32-rtems-elf tool chain build scripts from the MilkyMist repo. 
The lm32-elf Makefile is the same without appying the RTEMS and MilkyMist patches.

These were successfully built on Ubuntu 13.04, x86_64 with "gcc version 4.7.3 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-1ubuntu1)"
